## :pushpin:	 Motivation
It was inspired by countless hours of debugging my assembly homework.<br><br>
If you're familiar with assembly, you've probably experienced your antivirus yelling at you. Before I really understood how to solve the problem, I would simply turn off my pc protection (don't do that). I would cut my internet access because... well... no security... you get the idea<br><br>
